=head1 NAME

Mojo-Chrome - A Mojo interface to Chrome DevTools Protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::Chrome> is an interface to the Chrome DevTools Protocol which allows interaction with a (possibly headless) chrome instance.
Communication is bidirectional and asynchronous via an internal websocket.
Both request/response and push-events are commonplace, though this module does its best to simplify things.

While L<Mojo::Chrome> is primarily intended as a backbone for L<Test::Mojo::Role::Chrome>.this is not its only purpose.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module is nwe and changes may occur.
High level functionality should be fairly stable.

The protocol itself is fairly new and largely undocumented, especially in usage documentation.
If this module skews from the protocol in newer versions of chrome please alert the author via the bug tracker.
Incompatibilites can hopefully be smoothed out in the module however where this isn't possible the author intends to target newer versions of chrome rather than support a long tail of chrome version.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Mojo::Chrome> inherits all of the events from L<Mojo::EventEmitter>.
Further it emits events that arrive from the protocol as they arrive.
Per the protocol most events are disabled initially, though some methods will enable and subscribe to events as a matter of course.

Eventually this documentation might suggest best practices or contain other functionality to moderate events.
For the time being simply consider that fact, especially when disabling protocol events.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Mojo::Chrome> inherits all of the attributes from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 base

A base url used to make relative urls absolute.
Must be an instance of L<Mojo::URL> or api compatible class.

=head2 chrome_path

Path to the chrome executable.
Default is to use L<Mojo::Chrome::Util/chrome_executable> to discover it.

=head2 chrome_options

An array reference containing additional command line arguments to pass when executing chrome.
The default includes C<--headless>, it does not include C<--disable-gpu> thought that is a common usage.

=head2 host

The IP address of the host running chrome.
By default this is C<127.0.0.1>, namely the current host.

=head2 port

The port of the chrome process.
The default is to open an unused port.
This should be specified if a remote chrome instance (see C</host>).
